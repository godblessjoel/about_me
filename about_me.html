	<h2> Learn About me .. Joey üòù</h2>
	<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>Hi! my name is Joel Pena. There are many things to learn about me, but if you're truly invested in me then I'll let you in on my Five Favorites. My Five Favorites consists of my favorite movie, videogame, food, clothing store, and school subject. I'll start off with my favorite movie! One of my all time favorite movie has to be High School Musical (no shame). This is for many reasons. I feel that East High, the school setting, is some sort of utopia for the idea high school life. Everyone in this movie is farely happy and have nothing but a good time using musical numbers.</p>
	
		<p> On anthor note. My favorite videogame/s is Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto has many outcomes to offer, considering it's a game that allows you to do as you please while completing the story. This is especially signficant to me due to the fact that I prefer to deciede my characters path. In addition to choosing my characters path, I also enjoy the ability to customize cars. Although that many seem like a small factor to the game, it's important to me and my love for cars. 
		With my love for cars comes my love for food. Food is important to anyone including me. I've tried manys kinds of foods for differetn cultural backgrounds, but one cultural food that stood out to me is pasta from Italy. Well not specifically from Italy, but with italian style. Within the catergory, Pasta, my favorite type of pasta is penne vodka with chicken cutlet! The mix of flavors settling on your taste buds is extremely satisfying on a complex level hard to understand without trying for yourself.</p>

		<h2> Technology üì±</h2>
			<p>
				I have an Iphone that I use as much as possible. I rely heavily on my phone for many reasons. One being that my phone helps me stay connected to the wortld through applications. These applications come in my forms. One being Instagram. Instagram allows me to post pictures to share to my friends, while also allowing me to like and comment on their pictures as well.
